=== Testing Polymorphism ===
Rectangle: 10x5 (area: 50)
Area: 50

=== Testing RTTI ===
Type of shape: 9Rectangle
Successfully cast to Rectangle
Rectangle: 10x5 (area: 50)
Failed to cast to Circle (expected)
Rectangle destructor
Shape destructor: Rectangle

--- Creating Circle ---
Shape constructor: Circle
Circle constructor: radius=7

=== Testing Polymorphism ===
Circle: radius=7 (area: 153.938)
Area: 153.938

=== Testing RTTI ===
Type of shape: 6Circle
Failed to cast to Rectangle (expected)
Successfully cast to Circle
Circle: radius=7 (area: 153.938)
Circle destructor
Shape destructor: Circle

=== Testing Exception Handling ===
