## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use this for a closed-source commercial project?
**A:** Yes, with a commercial license. The default CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license does not permit commercial use.

### Q: Can I modify the code for my company's internal use?
**A:** Yes, but you need a commercial license. Internal business use is considered commercial use.

### Q: What if I'm building an open-source tool that uses this transpiler?
**A:** If your open-source project is non-commercial (no revenue, no commercial services), the default CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license applies. For commercial open-source projects (e.g., dual-licensed, commercial support services), you need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I use this in a university research project?
**A:** Yes, the default CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license covers non-commercial academic research. No commercial license needed.

### Q: What happens if I need support?
**A:** The default license includes community support only (GitHub issues). Commercial licenses include priority email support with guaranteed response times.

### Q: Are there any restrictions on the number of developers?
**A:** Individual/Startup licenses may have developer limits. Enterprise licenses typically allow unlimited developers within your organization.

### Q: Can I get a refund?
**A:** Commercial licenses are generally non-refundable after delivery. Contact us to discuss specific situations.
