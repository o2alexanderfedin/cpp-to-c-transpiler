# Research Task: Existing Clang Transformation Tools Analysis

## Objective
Study how clang-tidy, clang-refactor, and other tools transform AST. Extract patterns.

## Research Questions
1. How does clang-tidy implement fixes?
2. What AST transformation patterns do they use?
3. What limitations do they hit?
4. Can we reuse their infrastructure?
5. What lessons can we learn?

## Deliverables
1. Tool analysis (500+ lines)
2. Code pattern extraction
3. Reusable infrastructure identification
4. Best practices guide

## Output File
