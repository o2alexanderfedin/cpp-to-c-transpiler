# Research Task: Clang CodeGen C Backend Investigation

## Objective
Investigate if/how Clang can generate C code from AST. Understand llvm-cbe and alternatives.

## Research Questions
1. Does Clang have a C backend?
2. What is llvm-cbe and why does it produce unreadable code?
3. Can we use Clang's CodeGen differently?
4. What would it take to create a C backend?
5. Is this approach viable?

## Deliverables
1. CodeGen architecture analysis (400+ lines)
2. llvm-cbe evaluation and example output
3. Alternative approaches
4. Feasibility assessment

## Output File
`.prompts/004-ast-transformation-architecture/research-notes/04-clang-codegen-c.md`
