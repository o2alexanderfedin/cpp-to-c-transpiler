# Research Task: Clang Rewriter API Analysis

## Objective
Investigate Clang's Rewriter class for text-based source modifications. Document use cases, limitations.

## Research Questions
1. How does Rewriter work?
2. What operations supported (insert/delete/replace)?
3. Does it update AST?
4. Can it handle complex transformations?
5. Integration with other Clang tools?

## Deliverables
1. API documentation (300+ lines)
2. Working example: text-based transformation
3. Comparison with TreeTransform
4. Assessment for C++ to C conversion

## Output File
`.prompts/004-ast-transformation-architecture/research-notes/02-rewriter-api.md`
