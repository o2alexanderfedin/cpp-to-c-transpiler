# Research Task: ASTConsumer and ASTFrontendAction Analysis

## Objective
Investigate how to create custom AST consumers and integrate into Clang pipeline for transformation passes.

## Research Questions
1. How to create custom ASTConsumer?
2. How to integrate into Clang pipeline?
3. Can we run multiple transformation passes?
4. How does this relate to LibTooling?
5. What's the execution model?

## Deliverables
1. ASTConsumer tutorial (400+ lines)
2. Working prototype: custom consumer
3. Multi-pass transformation example
4. Integration guide

## Output File
`.prompts/004-ast-transformation-architecture/research-notes/03-astconsumer-frontend.md`
