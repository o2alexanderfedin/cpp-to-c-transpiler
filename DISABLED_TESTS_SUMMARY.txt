## Total Disabled: 29 test targets

Each disabled block has been commented out with the marker:
`# DISABLED: Uses obsolete handleDecl API - needs rewrite for dispatcher pattern`

## Test Files Not in CMakeLists.txt (4 files)

The following test files exist but were never added to CMakeLists.txt:
- tests/e2e/phase45/VirtualMethodsE2ETest.cpp
- tests/integration/comparison-operators/ComparisonOperatorsIntegrationTest.cpp
- tests/integration/handlers/ClassesIntegrationTest.cpp
- tests/integration/handlers/EnumIntegrationTest.cpp

These files don't require any action as they were never configured as test targets.

## Backup

A backup of the original CMakeLists.txt has been saved to: CMakeLists.txt.backup
