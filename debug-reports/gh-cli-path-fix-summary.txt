GitHub CLI PATH Issue - Fix Summary
====================================

Date: 2025-12-15
Status: RESOLVED

Issue:
------
The bash script `~/.claude/skills/lib/gh-projects/gh-project-list.sh` could not find 
the `gh` CLI command when executed from the project directory, but worked fine from 
the home directory.

Root Cause:
-----------
When bash scripts are invoked through certain contexts (like Claude Code's skill system,
cron jobs, or automation tools), they may run with a minimal PATH that doesn't include
homebrew directories where `gh` is installed (/opt/homebrew/bin).

Fix Applied:
------------
Added explicit PATH setup to /Users/alexanderfedin/.claude/skills/lib/gh-projects/lib/gh-project-common.sh:

  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

This ensures gh CLI and other homebrew tools are found regardless of invocation context.

Files Modified:
---------------
- /Users/alexanderfedin/.claude/skills/lib/gh-projects/lib/gh-project-common.sh (lines 6-8)

Verification Results:
--------------------
✓ Script works from project directory: ~/Projects/hapyy/hupyy-cpp-to-c
✓ Script works from home directory: ~
✓ Script works with restricted PATH environments
✓ All 16 gh-projects scripts benefit from this fix
✓ No regressions detected

Testing Commands:
-----------------
cd ~/Projects/hapyy/hupyy-cpp-to-c
~/.claude/skills/lib/gh-projects/gh-project-list.sh --type epic --format json
# Returns: [] (0 epics, but command executes successfully)

~/.claude/skills/lib/gh-projects/gh-project-list.sh --format json | jq 'length'
# Returns: 163 (total items in project)
