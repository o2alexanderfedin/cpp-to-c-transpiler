## EFFORT CALCULATION INPUTS

### Industry Benchmarks (from meta-prompt)
Compiler/Transpiler LOC/hour:    6-15 LOC/hour (complex)
Runtime Library LOC/hour:       30-60 LOC/day
Tests LOC/hour:                 50-100 LOC/day
Documentation:                 500-1000 words/day (2-4 pages)

### Project Complexity Factors
- Compiler-level complexity (AST transformation)
- 15 major feature categories
- Formal verification requirements (Frama-C)
